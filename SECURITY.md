# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible for receiving such patches depends on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report (suspected) security vulnerabilities to **[security@tokenizin.dev](mailto:security@tokenizin.dev)**. You will receive a response from us within 48 hours. If the issue is confirmed, we will release a patch as soon as possible depending on complexity but historically within a few days.

## Disclosure Policy

1. Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
2. Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
3. Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance.
4. Release new versions of all affected packages.
